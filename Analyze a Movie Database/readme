# ðŸŽ¬ Analyze a Movie Database using SQL

This project demonstrates how to explore and analyze a movie database using structured queries (SQL). 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights such as top-rated movies, genre trends, and rating behavior using SQL features like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

To apply core SQL concepts to analyze movie-related data and answer questions such as:
- What are the top 5 highest-rated movies?
- Which genres are most frequently rated?
- Are there movies with no ratings at all?

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL / SQLite syntax)
- SQLBolt (for query practice)

## ðŸ“Š SQL Concepts Used

| Concept         | Use Case                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `JOIN`          | Combine movies with their ratings |
| `GROUP BY`      | Aggregate ratings by genre/title  |
| `HAVING`        | Filter grouped results            |
| `ORDER BY`      | Rank top movies                   |
| `LEFT JOIN`     | Identify unrated movies           |

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Summary Insights

- Top-rated movie: Inception
- Most-rated genre: Sci-Fi
- Many movies still have zero user ratings, indicating data gaps
- SQL helps quickly surface both trends and anomalies
