# üö¢ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand survival patterns based on passenger features like age, class, gender, and fare.

---

## üéØ Objective

To investigate and visualize:
- Who survived and who didn‚Äôt
- How survival was influenced by gender, age, and passenger class
- Relationships between key features using pandas and Seaborn

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes data on passengers from the Titanic shipwreck.

| Column         | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `PassengerId`  | Unique ID of the passenger               |
| `Survived`     | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)               |
| `Pclass`       | Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) |
| `Name`         | Name of the passenger                    |
| `Sex`          | Gender                                   |
| `Age`          | Age in years                             |
| `SibSp`        | Number of siblings/spouses aboard        |
| `Parch`        | Number of parents/children aboard        |
| `Fare`         | Ticket fare                              |
| `Embarked`     | Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton) |

| Task                               | Description                               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Load and clean dataset             | Checked nulls, converted data types       |
| Handle missing values              | Filled `Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin` |
| Analyze survival distribution      | Used count plots and histograms           |
| Compare fare and age distributions | Boxplots and histograms                   |
| Extract insights from features     | GroupBy + value counts                    |
