# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model using Python to predict house prices based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and age. 
The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and the property price, and use that to make future predictions.

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict housing prices based on multiple numerical features
- Explore the relationship between area, bedrooms, and price
- Evaluate model accuracy using regression metrics
- Visualize actual vs predicted values

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes basic features of 10 houses.

| Column Name     | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Area (sqft)`    | Size of the house in square feet       |
| `Bedrooms`       | Number of bedrooms                     |
| `Bathrooms`      | Number of bathrooms                    |
| `Age (years)`    | Age of the house in years              |
| `Price`          | Target variable (in USD)               |

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Load and explore data        | Using `pandas.read_csv()` and `.describe()`      |
| Visualize relationships      | Scatter plot, boxplot to explore trends          |
| Prepare features and labels  | Separate predictors (X) and target (y)           |
| Train Linear Regression      | Using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()`  |
| Evaluate performance         | Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score               |
| Plot predictions             | Actual vs Predicted plot with `matplotlib`       |
