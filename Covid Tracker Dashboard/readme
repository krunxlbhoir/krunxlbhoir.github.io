# 🦠 COVID Tracker Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project demonstrates the development of an interactive dashboard in Power BI to track the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The dashboard visualizes key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and trends over time, based on real-world data.

## 🎯 Objective

- Visualize the progression of COVID-19 cases across countries and continents
- Track trends in daily cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Enable interactive filtering by country, date, and region
- Present data through KPI cards, charts, maps, and slicers
